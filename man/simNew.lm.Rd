\title{Generate simulations of response of a fitted \code{lm} object on new data}
\usage{
\method{simNew}{lm}(object, newdata, nsim = 100, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class inheriting from "lm"}

\item{newdata}{a data frame where to look for variables to predict}

\item{nsim}{the number of simulations to return for each observation in the new dataset. Must be greater than 1.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
a \code{nrow(newdata) x nsim} sized matrix. Each row corresponds to an observation in the new dataset,
  and each colulmn corresponds to a draw/simulation.
}
\description{
Returns a matrix of simulated responses from a fitted lm object, applied to a new dataset
  separate from the original data used to fit the model.
